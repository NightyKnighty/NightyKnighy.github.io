        <h3 class="post-title">A day out of NS</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Its friday again and guess what? its book out:) The moment i book out, tried to learn how to make a choice based game after viewing <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/" target="_blank">Choice
              script</a>. but after i read through their tutorials, i realised that it was actually really hard to make one as i had to think of 2 or more other scenarios besides the main storyline which i have already thought of. So.. I drop the
            idea of making a chioce base game for now:/ Lesson learnt: Don't be too over ambitious.
          </p>
          <p>I also just got an achievement <a href="mimo-certificate.html" target="_blank">certificate</a> for successfully completing the /'make a website'/ module in the <a href="https://getmimo.com" target="_blank">Mimo</a> app. Now i will be
            moving on to achieve the '/Become a Web Developer' certificate. I'm confident that i will finish it in a month's time.
          </p>
          <p> I recently countered a junior who has a diploma in game design. He recommended me to use unity if i'm planning on making a game. Thus, I might consider making a game if we get close even for me to ask him for help.
          </p>
          <p> Today's idea is to make a simple flowchart game title /"Which anime character are you?"/ using the choicescript as mention above. I know i said i will put the choicescript off for another time, but i did not say that i could not use it
            to make something else? And i think it is a pretty good intro into the new coding language before i start to really code for my CYOA story.

        <h3 class="post-title">A day in NS</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Currently, I'm stuck in NS until... Jan 2020 TT.TT but that doesn't mean that I stop editing my code:) Besides I need something to keep me busy these 1 year.
          </p>
          <p>Alright, enough of NS. let's talk about my blog. Since I'm stuck in NS, my plan is to use my mobile phone to edit my html language until Friday where I will copy and paste the changes on my computer to update my blog. Although I don't
            really have the right environment to brainstorm creative ideas for my blog.. I need to try my best if not i can't improve it for business purposes in the future.
          </p>
          <p> The plan right now is to think of one idea a day, be it small or big. Whether it takes 10mins or a few days , an idea a day keeps the mind at day XD.
          </p>
          <p> Today's idea is to make a webgame and place it in my webpage under a new page called game.html So, I'm guessing I will be spending the entire weekend going through the tutorials for Unity or Android Studio. But most probably I will be
            using Unity and then I well learn how to load the game into my webpage. I might be abit over ambitious but I would still like to try this idea.

        <h3 class="post-title">A typical Sunday before i go back to NS</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>This morning, i spent 2 hours trying to get the footer to stick to the bottom because there was a bug that drag the content area along with the footer, resulting a very ugly website. I later found out that it was not the footer's
            problem but the content on the left and right which overlaped with the content in the centre, pushing the centre content downwards. What a waste of time...
            <strong>BUT</strong>, i still learnt a very important debugging lesson which is that the margin boundaries along the same plane can affect the appearance of the website when it is zoomed.
          </p>
          <p>A few hours later, i thought of adding a seach bar in the website. I came across <a href="https://cse.google.com/cse/setup/basic?cx=011568753431052033472%3An6neve7dymm" target="_blank">Google Custom Seach</a> and started to work on it
            as shown on the right of the website. It was quite a challenge cause i am completely new to this, but if you search the internet long enough, you will be able to find the answers to your questions. in the process of finding the answers
            to my questions, i stubble upon two helpful websites that gave me alot of advice in coding html. They are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackover flow</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">Css
              Tricks</a>. They have been my source of help whenever a new idea pop into my head for my website.

        <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p> Today i learnt how to do styles using css which help make the blog more appleaing to me. I also had a brief encounter with what is called debugging..
          </p>
          <p>I plan on continuing this blog until i decide what should i use this new found knowledge for. So far i only have plans to build a website that helps organise my files neatly instead of using the current computer's file system. But now
            i'm still in NS so i can only edit the website code every website:( what a waste.
          </p>
          <p> My second idea is to help translate chinese comics and place them here as i already know how to do it. But its very tedious. I think i can only translate 1 chapter of 30 pages per week..
