        <h4 class="post-title">A typical Sunday before i go back to NS</h4>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>This morning, i spent 2 hours trying to get the footer to stick to the bottom because there was a bug that drag the content area along with the footer, resulting a very ugly website. I later found out that it was not the footer's
            problem but the content on the left and right which overlaped with the content in the centre, pushing the centre content downwards. What a waste of time...
            <strong>BUT</strong>, i still learnt a very important debugging lesson which is that the margin boundaries along the same plane can affect the appearance of the website when it is zoomed.
          </p>
          <p>A few hours later, i thought of adding a seach bar in the website. I came across <a href="https://cse.google.com/cse/setup/basic?cx=011568753431052033472%3An6neve7dymm" target="_blank">Google Custom Seach</a> and started to work on it
            as shown on the right of the website. It was quite a challenge cause i am completely new to this, but if you search the internet long enough, you will be able to find the answers to your questions. in the process of finding the answers
            to my questions, i stubble upon two helpful websites that gave me alot of advice in coding html. They are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackover flow</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">Css
              Tricks</a>. They have been my source of help whenever a new idea pop into my head for my website.

      <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p> Today i learnt how to do styles using css which help make the blog more appleaing to me. I also had a brief encounter with what is called debugging..
        </p>
        <p>I plan on continuing this blog until i decide what should i use this new found knowledge for. So far i only have plans to build a website that helps organise my files neatly instead of using the current computer's file system. But now
          i'm still in NS so i can only edit the website code every website:( what a waste.
        </p>
        <p> My second idea is to help translate chinese comics and place them here as i already know how to do it. But its very tedious. I think i can only translate 1 chapter of 30 pages per week..
